### Model statement for the multinomial logistic regression is below 

`In(P(crimegroup=drug related)/P(crime group=sex related) )=β_10 + β_11 Bronx+β_12 Brooklyn+β_13 Queens+ β_14 Staten_island`

`In(P(crimegroup=weapon related)/P(crime group=sex related) )=β_20 + β_21 Bronx+β_22 Brooklyn+β_23 Queens+ β_24 Staten_island`

### Making manhattan the and sex-related crime the reference groups 
sex_drug_weapons = sex_drug_weapons%>%
  mutate(crime_group = forcats::fct_relevel(crime_group, "Drug-Related"),
         boro_nm = forcats::fct_relevel(boro_nm, "manhattan"))

```

### Tabulation

```{r}
with(sex_drug_weapons, table(boro_nm, crime_group)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
fit = multinom(crime_group ~ boro_nm, data = sex_drug_weapons) %>% broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate( OR = exp(estimate))

fit %>% knitr::kable()

```

```{r}

ggplot(fit, aes(x = term, y = OR)) +
  geom_segment( aes(x = term, xend = term, y = 0, yend = OR), color = "grey") +
  geom_point(color = "orange", size = 3) + facet_grid(~ y.level)
  theme_light() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank())

```
