## Our Drive For The Project

In times past, mental health seemed to have lots of myths associated with it. However recently, a lot of conversations are going on around it to create much awareness. According to [MentalHealth.gov](https://www.mentalhealth.gov/basics), mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being and it largely affects the quality for an individual. The factors that contribute to mental health issues include biological factors, family history and LIFE EXPERIENCES SUCH AS TRAUMA OR ABUSE. 

Trauma and/or abuse can occur or result from being a victim of a crime, especially a felony. Although New York City is not listed on the top 10 cities with high crime rates in the United States, New York City is the most populated city in the country and even ond of the most populated cities in the world. Essentially, the crime rates may not be the highest, but collectively, the ripple effects of crimes may impact more people. We feel it is important to know the statistics on felonies, especially as experienced by victims. We believe such information may provide important indicators for mental health advocacy. 

Our passionate about mental health led us to explore data on the three main categories of felonies (sex-related, weapon-related and drug-related) that occured in New York City from 2014 to 2017.



## Data sources

We used the dataset collected by the New York City Police Department (NYPD); specifically, the NYPD Historic Complaint dataset, which provides longitudinal information on complaints filed to the NYPD, the type of crimes committed by a suspect, suspect demographics, victim demographics, location of crime, date and time of crime, and other variables.

##Project Description

We conducted various exploratory and formal analyses of different variables associated with reported felonies across the boroughs in New York City from 2014 to 2017. The variables of interest included: sociodemographics, day/seasonality, and other trends). 

We were interested in looking at a dataset containing information on NYPD crime complaints because there is a wealth of information and variables in the dataset. It is particularly exciting that we were able to study the variables longitudinally, as well as by discrete categories such as borough and crime category (sex-related, weapon-related and drug-related). 

Furthermore, the dataset provided both victim and suspect demographic information, allowing us to link this information to either crime category, the crime location, or to each other. Lastly, the dataset provided ample opportunities to visualize interesting patterns associated with crime category, crime location (boroughs, distinct zipcodes and places), time of crime, and the demographics of victims.


## Analyses

For the analyses, we used both graphical elements and functions (e.g., ggplot, plotly, shiny, dashboard) and data frames/tables to demonstrate longitudinal trends and trends by type of crime or location. We also included a Flex Dashboard and Shiny app controls to provide stratification by different variables. 


## Some Interesting Findings

Overall, there were 19,753 victims for weapon-related crimes, 18,293 for drug-related crimes and 8,646 for sex-related crimes within the time period. Victims for weapon-related crimes mostly within the 25-44 age-group (38%) and were more likely to be black (53%). Most victims for drug-related crimes were unknown or unidentified. Majority of victims of sex-related crimes were below 18 years (42%), were females (90%), and were blacks (38%).    

Most crimes were heavily concentrated in the Bronx and Brooklun. Bronx captured the highest felonies rates, although just as other boroughs, there has been a consistent decline throughout the 4 years. Interestingly, in Brooklyn however, drug-related felonies were on the rise within the years captured.
